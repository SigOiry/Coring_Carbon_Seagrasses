For each study site, images were manually inspected to ensure they were cloud-free and acquired during low tide conditions. One image per year was selected, preferably around the date of maximum meadow extent as reported by Davies et al. (2024). To minimize interannual variability, images from the same Sentinel-2 tile were selected for each site. All images selected were pre-processed using baseline version 4.00 or higher. Consequently, 1000 was subtracted from the raw reflectance values of each band to obtain usable surface reflectance values (More info)."

After applying the transformation, pixels with exceptionally high NDVI occasionally resulted in SPC values exceeding 100%. These were capped at 100%.\n\n\nHistorical seagrass patches of the meadow\nTo identify consistent high-coverage areas within the meadow, we calculated the number of consecutive years—starting from 2024—in which each pixel exhibited an SPC above 50%. For example, a value of 0 indicates that in 2024 the SPC was below 50%, while a value of 5 means that SPC exceeded 50% every year since 2019 (i.e., 2024 − 5), but not in 2018.\n\n\nYear of the maximum of cover\nFor each pixel, the year corresponding to its maximum SPC value during the time series was identified and recorded.\n\n\nRate of decline since the date of maximum\nStarting from the year of maximum SPC, a linear regression was fitted for each pixel to model SPC change over time. The slope of the regression line, when statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05), was assigned as the pixel’s rate of decline (expressed as percent cover change per year)."

    "text": "Cádiz Bay is a large coastal lagoon located in southwestern Spain, along the Atlantic coast of Andalusia, near the city of Cádiz. Sheltered by a system of sandbars and low-lying coastal plains, the lagoon is fringed by salt marshes, tidal creeks, and mudflats. It features broad intertidal areas that support extensive seagrass meadows, primarily composed of Zostera noltei and Zostera marina. These meadows are particularly prominent in the inner parts of the lagoon and are exposed during low tide. As shown in Figure 1, the area analyzed in this study covers more than 7 km². Has water level varies greatly between images, the intertidal mask has been drawn in a conservative way, overestimating the actual intertidal area. Saltmarsh areas are not concidered for this study and have therefore been removed from the mask.\nFigure 1: Intertidal Mask of Cadiz Bay\nFor this site, a time series of the Sentinel-2 missions has been used to monitor the seagrass meadow since 2017 (Table 1).
