    "text": "Bourgneuf Bay is a broad, shallow coastal bay situated on the French Atlantic coast, between the island of Noirmoutier and the mainland. Bordered by salt marshes, oyster farms, and mudflats, it is characterized by its extensive intertidal zones. The bay hosts large seagrass meadows, mainly composed of Zostera noltei, which cover wide areas of the seabed. These meadows are especially visible at low tide and stretch across the southern and western parts of the bay. As shown in Figure 1, the area considered in this study spans more than 23 km².\nFigure 1: Intertidal Mask of Bourgneuf Bay\nFor this site, a time series combining images from the Landsat, SPOT, and Sentinel-2 missions has been used to monitor the seagrass meadow since 1985 (Table 1). This work was published by Zoffoli et al. (2021). The present work updates the time series from Zoffoli et al. (2021) by incorporating newly available images and computing additional metrics (see Methodology).\nTable 1\n\n\n\nDateCapteurDateCapteurDateCapteurseptembre 13, 1985Landsatseptembre 24, 2002SPOTseptembre 30, 2015Sentinel-2octobre 02, 1986Landsatseptembre 26, 2003SPOTaoût 22, 2016Sentinel-2juillet 26, 1987Landsatseptembre 17, 2004Landsatoctobre 06, 2017Sentinel-2octobre 15, 1988SPOTseptembre 18, 2005SPOTseptembre 14, 2018Sentinel-2septembre 04, 1990Landsatseptembre 23, 2006Landsatseptembre 16, 2019Sentinel-2septembre 28, 1991SPOTseptembre 28, 2008Landsatseptembre 05, 2020Sentinel-2septembre 20, 1993SPOTseptembre 08, 2009SPOTseptembre 23, 2021Sentinel-2octobre 11, 1995Landsatseptembre 12, 2010SPOTaoût 11, 2022Sentinel-2septembre 07, 1997SPOToctobre 02, 2011SPOTseptembre 03, 2023Sentinel-2septembre 21, 1998SPOTseptembre 28, 2012SPOTseptembre 17, 2024Sentinel-2septembre 02, 2001Landsatoctobre 05, 2013SPOT\nList of Satellite images used to follow the meadows in Bourngeuf Bay"

Three key periods stand out: 1985–1986, 2002, and 2022. In 1985–1986, more than 15% of the meadow reached its highest SPC values in the time series. These are shown as red pixels in Figure 4, typically located along the edges of the meadow. In 2002, 28% of the meadow reached its historical maximum, corresponding to yellow areas in Figure 4, where the meadow expanded eastward and westward. Finally, in 2022, 52% of the meadow reached its highest recorded SPC, represented by blue areas in Figure 4, mainly located in the central part of the meadow."

On average, the meadow has been losing 1.78% of its seagrass cover per year since reaching its maximum. However, certain areas located in the central part of the meadow—likely where fishermen regularly carry out clam fishing activities—are experiencing much sharper declines, with rates reaching up to 25% per year."
